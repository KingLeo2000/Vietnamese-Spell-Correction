# Vietnamese-Spell-Correction

## Training and evaluating phase before [web application deploying](https://github.com/KingLeo2000/vietnamese-spell-correct-and-text-classify)

### Data :
- [Data source](https://github.com/duyvuleo/VNTC) (*.txt files*)
- [Data folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/16IjAeRrKJmLIZfKicbOcyhLaMT5RN1IT) ( *a single .pkl file*) 
### Usage :
- Download the Data folder and put it into our repo
- Then, you can explore my approach in notebooks
### Detail:
- [First training phase](https://github.com/KingLeo2000/Vietnamese-Spell-Correction/blob/master/train_spell.ipynb) 
- [Load pretrained model and transfer learning on another data](https://github.com/KingLeo2000/Vietnamese-Spell-Correction/blob/master/transfer_spell.ipynb)
- [Evaluate model](https://github.com/KingLeo2000/Vietnamese-Spell-Correction/blob/master/evaluate_spell.ipynb)
### Result

### Notes
- This model is adapted from the seq2seq architecture( Sequence-to-sequence models are deep learning models that have achieved a lot of success in tasks like machine translation, text summarization, and image captioning )
- There are some disadvantages when addressing social media data (Facebook, Zalo, Twitter, ... ) 
( *this model is overfit with artificial data, which is generated by [add_noise.py](https://github.com/KingLeo2000/Vietnamese-Spell-Correction/blob/master/add_noise.py)* )
### It actually need the labeled real data for practical application
